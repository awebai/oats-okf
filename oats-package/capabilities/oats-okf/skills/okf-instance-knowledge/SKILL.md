description: >-
  Keeping this instance's own knowledge (STATE.md, log.md, notes/) with
  judgment: the capture test, what is worth writing down and what is not,
  one concept per note with type, claim, why, evidence and generality, when to
  write (at the decision, before compaction, before a task boundary), and how
  a note cites the soul knowledge it confirms or contradicts. Use at the start
  of every task, when a decision is taken or rejected, when something costs
  effort to find out, when a human corrects you, before compaction, and
  before finishing a task.

# Instance knowledge

Your instance knowledge is your working memory: what you are doing, what
happened, and what you learned. It lives in instance home (not ./work):
- **STATE.md**: the current task picture, **rewritten** as it changes. What
  the task is, where it stands, what is decided, what is blocked. `# Next`
  names ONE next step.
- **log.md**: dated significant events, **append-only**. Never rewrite
  history.
- **notes/**: **one concept per insight**, one Markdown file each.

Your future self reads it after compaction. When harvest is on, the knowledge
harvester reads it with your session transcript and decides what becomes soul
knowledge. Write for both.

## The capture test

> Would my future self after compaction, or the harvester judging this

Both halves must hold. The capture bar is lower than the promotion bar: you
capture what might matter; the harvester promotes what does. Do not
self-censor a real decision because it might not be promoted.

## Capture

- **Decisions taken, and why.** The why is the part that dies with you.
- **Alternatives rejected, and why.** Code shows the outcome, never the road
  not taken; without this, a later instance "helpfully" takes it.
- **Discoveries that cost effort**: facts about the world that were written
  nowhere.
- **Limitations, and the workaround that worked.**
- **Conclusions of an investigation**, not its transcript.
- **Blockers**, with what they block and what unblocks them.
- **Human direction and corrections**, as you understood them, with when.
- **Surprises**: the world behaved differently from what your soul knowledge
  says. That is a *candidate supersession*: flag it as one and cite the
  concept it contradicts.
- **Process and environment lessons** the repository cannot express.

## Don't capture

- Descriptions of the code, or maps of the repository: code is the truth
  about code, and a stored description drifts and lies.
- Command logs and tool output; retries that taught nothing.
- Secrets and credentials, however they appear.
- Third-party messages verbatim (a lesson *about* one is fine).
- What the tracker or the docs already hold: link to it instead.

## The form of a note

```markdown
---
type: Decision            # Decision | Rejected | Discovery | Limitation | Conclusion | Lesson | Blocker
title: Retry budget is per request, not per connection
description: One-line claim, the sentence an index would show.
generality: soul          # instance (true only for this task) | soul (likely true for the soul) — a hint, not a verdict
observed: 2026-09-26, load test on the staging cluster (turns around the 14:10 run)
---

The claim, then **why**: the reasoning, the alternatives, the evidence.
Relates to: oats/expert/decisions/retries.md@5b6a9cab (refines it).
```

- A one-line claim in `description`; the *why* in the body.
- Evidence and provenance: what was observed, when, from what.
- **Generality** tells the harvester whether you think it outlives the task.
- A note that confirms, refines or contradicts soul knowledge **cites it**
  (`alias/node/concept.md@<short-oid>`, from `oats okf`'s receipt). That is
  what lets the harvester situate it.

## When

- **At the decision, as it happens.** A decision reconstructed at the end has
  lost its why.
- **Before compaction** and **before a task boundary**: update STATE.md and
  log.md, and write the notes you have been meaning to write.
- **Consult first**: before writing a note, check notes/ and `oats okf search`
  so you refine or cite rather than duplicate.

## The theory, briefly

- **Decision versus description.** A decision is superseded explicitly, and
  the new one names the old; a description goes stale silently. Capture
  decisions, not descriptions.
- **Code is truth about code.** Anything a fresh instance could learn from
  the repository in ten minutes is not worth your note.
- **Indexical residue dies with the instance.** "Was working on X", "the PR
  from this morning" mean nothing to anyone else. Write the durable claim
  underneath it, or nothing.
